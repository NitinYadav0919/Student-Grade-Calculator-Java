# Student-Grade-Calculator-Java
This Java-based Student Grade Calculator is a console application that calculates a student’s grade based on entered scores. It uses object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, constructors, and methods. The program accepts user input, computes the average score, grades using conditional logic, and handles invalid inputs gracefully.
